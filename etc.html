(2011). “Student Perceptions Of The Information Professions And Their Master's Program In Information Studies.” Library & Information Science Research, 33(2), 120-131. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740818811000041?via%3Dihub
The article examines students' perceptions of the information professions and their master's program in information studies over a 4-year period. The study found that students were generally optimistic about job prospects in the information professions and believed that career opportunities were growing. They also recognized the significance of computer knowledge in the field. However, there were concerns about the social status and public understanding of the information professions. The study also assessed students' perceptions of their master's program, revealing overall satisfaction with the academic quality and professional aspects. However, there were differences in perceptions based on the program stage, with students who had completed fewer courses being more positive about the program. The study also highlighted the need for practical experience and internships in the program. Despite changes in administration and policies, student attitudes did not noticeably shift. The study provides valuable insights for educators and administrators in information studies programs to address the evolving needs and expectations of students.

	The Protocols for Native American Archival Materials is an important resource for archivists, librarians, historians, museum curators, anthropologists, and information professionals to be aware of and, if working with Native communities and cultural materials, to be intimately knowledgeable about. They are a guideline for how to respectfully interact with Native communities and cultural materials and to recognize the differences with which materials are viewed and understood. It was created by nineteen Native and non-Native information professionals in 2006 and is not meant to be an exhaustive list nor inalterable. Some of the key takeaways include: recognizing the sovereign governments of Native communities, the importance of consulting with tribal communities on working with their materials and enacting policies, rethinking accessibility, privacy, and boundaries with these materials, reciprocity, and raising awareness. Unethical use and mistreatment of Native cultural materials and neglecting to include Native people in the handling of these materials has been harmful. There is extreme weight in that as these communities have been experiencing harm for centuries. It is the least that information professionals can do to be aware of protocols such as these.</p>

O’Neil discusses the importance of internships as a high-impact practice for students in terms of career development and academic learning. It highlights the need for academic departments to address the reluctance towards vocational education and emphasizes the value of internships in providing hands-on learning, developing marketable skills, and fostering critical thinking and communication abilities. The article also explores various definitions of internships from different institutions and emphasizes the importance of intentional organization to achieve specific learning outcomes. Additionally, O’Neil mentions the role of supervision, reflection, and feedback in enhancing the quality of internships. The conclusion stresses the need for stakeholders like faculty, advisors, and employers to collaborate in helping students set and achieve explicit learning and career development goals through internships.</p>

This article discusses the ramifications of the 2007-2008 financial crisis on the job market for archivists in Ireland. It examines the challenges faced by newly qualified archivists, who often secure short-term contract positions or government-sponsored internships due to limited job stability. Poutch provides a detailed overview of the economic downturn's impact on unemployment rates and the heritage sector, particularly the archives profession. The establishment of the national internship scheme, JobBridge, is scrutinized for its implications on free labor exploitation. Results from a survey among newly qualified archivists reveal personal experiences and challenges, with many considering leaving the profession due to employment instability. The article also explores the perspectives of archival postgraduate courses and professional organizations, emphasizing the need for practical support, mentoring arrangements, and advocacy efforts to address employment challenges. Poutch concludes with suggestions to improve support frameworks and training opportunities for new archivists, offering valuable insights into navigating the Irish job market in this profession.</p>
<p class="text-white-75 mb-5"> SCA Board. “SCA Labor Issues Task Force Final Report.” https://www.calarchivists.org/Resources/Documents/Committees/Labor_Issues_Task_Force_Final_Report.pdf (accessed Mar. 11, 2024).

Yuri Shimoda mentioned the Society of California Archivists (SCA) Labor Issues Task Force. This is a committee formed in 2019 to address labor issues in the archival profession. The Task Force wrote a report based on a survey conducted to assess the current state of the archival profession and come up with recommendations and action items to improve conditions. Based on the survey, the biggest issues in the profession reported are: “the prevalence of temporary and term employment (83%); inadequate pay (81%); and a lack of diversity (54%)” (pg. 5). To work on these issues, it was recommended to create a standing committee, conduct regular surveys, hold labor-related programming and workshops, and spotlight labor work via regular sharing of labor issues by newsletter. This is an important resource to know of because it highlights current issues in this profession, which gets graduates of the program ready to know what they will be getting into upon entry into the archiving world. It also provides a resource to be able to advocate for better working conditions.</p>
