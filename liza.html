She highlights the archival profession's generosity in sharing information and knowledge, noting the prevalence of short-staffed organizations seeking collaboration and the abundance of mentors willing to provide advice freely. Later in her career, Liza stresses the importance of having a trusted confidante to navigate challenges. This confidante, preferably more experienced, offers empathetic support while encouraging a balanced perspective. Liza emphasizes the collaborative nature of problem-solving, underscoring the significance of seeking guidance and solutions from experienced mentors in the archival field.

                <h2 class="text-dark mb-5 text-center">Post&mdash;Graduation</h2>
                <p class="text-dark mb-5">Since Liza started in the archival field, she has found that some of the biggest changes have come from shifting understandings of Western archival theory and practice. <a href="https://www2.nau.edu/libnap-p/protocols.html">The Protocols for Native American Archival Materials</a> (PNAAM) were published in 2006 by a group of librarians, archivists, curators, historians and anthropologists, including representatives from fifteen Native American, First Nation, and Aboriginal communities. These protocols illustrate best practices for libraries and archives to responsibly handle Native American materials. Though PNAAM was presented to the Society of American Archivists (SAA) in 2008 and again in 2012, the organization declined to endorse them until 2018. SAA published a <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-council-endorsement-of-protocols-for-native-american-archival-materials">press release</a> after their endorsement apologizing for the culturally insensitive and white supremacist language used in initial criticisms of PNAAM and for the delay in endorsing the protocols. Liza describes the importance of this endorsement, as it pushed other organizations to adopt PNAAM, and how it fits into the more general trend of organizations examining and addressing past behavior. This is also indicative of a larger attitude shift within the archival field as it begins to acknowledge its problematic history and how this affects policies and practices in the present.

                <p>insert <audio src="#"></audio></p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-5">Liza has found that participating in the <a href="https://www.calarchivists.org/About_SCA/Committees/Labor_Advocacy_and_Public_Policy">Labor, Advocacy and Public Policy Committee of the SCA and Native American Archives Section (NAAS) of SAA</a> helped keep her abreast of current advocacy within the archival field. This includes labor issues, decolonialism and reparative work. She highlights in particular the very active nature of the the NAAS including their Indigenizing Archival Training program, a Mellon Foundation-funded project that is <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/news/2023/call-for-participants-indigenous-archival-training-program">&ldquo;aimed at Tribal archivists, museum professionals, leaders, and Tribal Historic Preservation Officers, and focuses on reframing Western-created &lsquo;best practices&rsquo</a>; in archives and recentering Indigenous values and traditional stewardship practices.&rdquo; SAA members can sign up for the NAAS <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/groups/native-american-archives-section/naar-listserv">listserv</a>. More generally, Liza encourages people who may not be satisfied at work to become involved with smaller organizations or committees within larger organizations. By finding avenues to advocate for what she believes in, Liza has been able to mold her own career and find fulfillment within the archival field</p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-5">insert <audio src="#"></audio></p>
                <p class="text-dark mb-5">She also urges people to learn and grow from challenges that are presented throughout their career. When dealing with difficult leadership, for example, she took it as an opportunity to think about how to not fall into that practice when she took on a leadership role in the future. In helping with this, mentors and trusted confidantes are extremely important. Liza emphasizes how much it has helped to have someone that will listen to and empathize with work problems, but ultimately help her come up with solutions. Having trusted confidantes within the field also goes for career advancement, as Liza found out about her current position through word of mouth. Stressing the importance of building connections within the field, she highlights the role of personal development and career advancement through professional relationships.</p>

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">For continued professional development and education, Liza recommends attending conferences that best feed your niche. This includes the Association of Moving Image Archivists &lpar;AMIA&rpar; conference for those working with audiovisual media, Art Libraries Society of North America &lpar;ARLIS&rpar; conference for art librarians, and the SCA conference for those in California. These conferences are often smaller and can present more opportunities for events and networking. She also encourages attending in-person conferences when possible. One of the good things about living in California is that many conferences are hosted within the state every few years. In 2024 and 2025 some of these conferences include the Rare Books and Manuscript Section &lpar;RBMS&rpar; of the American Library Association &lpar;ALA&rpar; conference in <a href="https://rbms.info/">Costa Mesa</a> June 25-28, 2024, ALA conference in <a href="https://2024.alaannual.org/">San Diego</a> June 27- July 1, 2024, International Conference of Indigenous Archives, Libraries, and Museums in <a href="https://www.atalm.org/">Palm Springs</a> November 12-14, 2024, and SAA conference in <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/am2025">Anaheim</a> August 24-27 2025. 
                        Liza also strongly encourages that professionals get involved with organizations that interest them and support their career goals. She feels welcomed and supported by SCA, believing that it is a proactive organization that serves its membership base well. Liza felt so appreciative of her time being involved with SCA that she was compelled to eventually become President, and is currently serving on the board as Immediate Past-President.  <a href="https://calarchivists.org/Membership_Info">Membership</a> in SCA includes discounts to attend workshops and the Annual General Meeting &lpar;AGM&rpar;, opportunities to receive scholarships to pay for both, networking opportunities, and access to the SCA Online Membership Directory. Workshops are coordinated by the Education Committee and are meant to facilitate professional development for archivists. <a href="https://calarchivists.org/https/calarchivists.org/sys/website/2024AGM">The AGM is virtual in 2024</a>, taking place April 15-19, and includes workshops, sessions, and Members, Leadership, and Board Meetings at the end of the conference. SCA is also a co-sponsor of <a href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/westernarchives/">the Journal of Western Archives</a>, which focuses on archival issues as they affect institutions in the American West.

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">Liza has also found that her work with LA as Subject &ldquo;keeps [her] honest.&rdquo; It is a way for her to connect with community archives and assist the groups passionately stewarding the history of Los Angeles. LA as Subject is a research alliance that aims to improve access to collections depicting Los Angeles history. This includes compiling <a href="https://laassubject.org/find-an-archive">an archive directory</a>, <a href="https://laassubject.org/resources">resources</a> for community archives, the yearly <a href="https://laassubject.org/archives-bazaar">Archives Bazaar</a>, and <a href="https://laassubject.org/about/archives-risk-committee">the Archives At Risk Committee</a>. This experience has been instrumental in learning how to work with many different kinds of people with widely varying knowledge about archival principles and practices. Being involved with this organization has made Liza continue to exercise these skills in a way that she doesn&apos;t get to the same extent through other jobs.</p>
