                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-5">Despite having different jobs, Yuri Shimoda and Liza Posas emphasize similar points about career development that they wish to present to future information professionals. One of the most prominent suggestions was to get as much professional experience as possible, the most obvious being via internships. Internships are vital because they can fill in the gaps of skills needed that classes in the MLIS program cannot meet. They also allow for opportunities to network, building connections with people already in the field you are interested in or finding new opportunities or organizations that can bolster your experience in a field. Which brings about another point: joining various organizations and clubs. If you follow your interests, there is a good chance you will come across organizations that encourage those interests. These organizations can work alongside you to create needed change in the field. Like many professions, there are diversity and ethics issues in the archival and library space that are largely being reshaped by various organizations and advocacy groups. These groups have been crucial for Yuri and Liza, as people-oriented individuals, because they truly wish to create a better work environment, not only for themselves, but for future professionals. Conversations on theory in MLIS classes are helpful and have aided in their advocacy work, but what has made Yuri and Liza successful in their careers has been all of the varying experiences they had and the organizations they are a part of.
