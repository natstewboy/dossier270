                            <dt>Inf Std 260&colon; Description &amp; Access</dt>
                            <dd>Description &amp; Access provided an introduction to databases. Knowledge of particular audio databases like Discogs, Music Brains, and ISRC are useful to an audio archivist.</dd>
                            <dt>Inf Std 464&colon; Metadata</dt>
                            <dd>Metadata expanded on the material of Description &amp; Access, and the knowledge of how databases are structured and implemented supports her work in both digital asset management and the creation of digital records for the materials she is responsible for.</dd>
                            <dt>Inf Std 289&colon; Audio Archiving</dt>
                            <dd>Audio Archiving provided an introduction to audio archiving skills, but notably did not teach her about recording sound. She also cautions that audio archiving is an expansive field, and one course was not enough to cover everything she has needed to know.</dd>
                            <dt>Inf Std 289&colon; Moving Image Technologies</dt>
                            <dd>Moving Image Technologies provided an introduction to film handling, identifying media types, handling the degradation of analog materials, and audiovisual editing software. Similar to Audio Archiving, this class was helpful for laying the groundwork, but Yuri emphasized how she needed to study outside of classes and further her knowledge beyond the MLIS, because it is not possible to pack everything into a program as short as the MLIS.</dd>
                            <dt>Inf Std 433&colon; Community&ndash;Based Archiving</dt>
                            <dd>Yuri appreciated Community-Based Archiving because the course taught grant writing and the power of reflection and feedback in improving archival systems. Despite not being directly relevant to audio archiving as a field, this class was rewarding both professionally and personally.</dd>
                        </dl>
                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-5">
                            Yuri underscores the insufficiency of introductory courses in preparing professionals for the complexities of audio archiving, aligning with students' desires for a more practically and professionally oriented program. Recognizing the value of collaboration with global experts, she emphasizes the importance of engaging with professional organizations to broaden networks and collaborate with diverse professionals. Motivated by her role as president of ARSC, Yuri envisions establishing two-year residency programs for new graduates to bridge the gap between experienced collectors and students to foster knowledge exchange. This aligns with other LIS students' desires for greater emphasis on professional work, such as internships, as highlighted in survey responses by Cherry et al. 2011. According to their survey, “The option of greater emphasis on professional work (e.g., internships) received support from over 90% of respondents and was the only option strongly supported by the majority” (129). Overall, Yuri advocates for initiatives that enhance practical training, foster collaboration, and contribute to a shared repository of knowledge in the audio archiving field, addressing students' calls for greater emphasis on practical experience to feel more confident in their skills upon completing their degree. In service of this, she recommends students join ARSC while completing the MLIS or as recent graduates, because there are further educational opportunities that are not available in school.
