                            <dd>Description &amp; Access provided an introduction to databases. Knowledge of particular audio databases like Discogs, Music Brains, and ISRC are useful to an audio archivist.</dd>

                            <dd>Metadata expanded on the material of Description &amp; Access, and the knowledge of how databases are structured and implemented supports her work in both digital asset management and the creation of digital records for the materials she is responsible for.</dd>

                            <dd>Audio Archiving provided an introduction to audio archiving skills, but notably did not teach her about recording sound. She also cautions that audio archiving is an expansive field, and one course was not enough to cover everything she has needed to know.</dd>

                            <dd>Moving Image Technologies provided an introduction to film handling, identifying media types, handling the degradation of analog materials, and audiovisual editing software. Similar to Audio Archiving, this class was helpful for laying the groundwork, but Yuri emphasized how she needed to study outside of classes and further her knowledge beyond the MLIS, because it is not possible to pack everything into a program as short as the MLIS.</dd>

                            <dd>Yuri appreciated Community-Based Archiving because the course taught grant writing and the power of reflection and feedback in improving archival systems. Despite not being directly relevant to audio archiving as a field, this class was rewarding both professionally and personally.</dd>

                            Yuri underscores the insufficiency of introductory courses in preparing professionals for the complexities of audio archiving, aligning with students' desires for a more practically and professionally oriented program. Recognizing the value of collaboration with global experts, she emphasizes the importance of engaging with professional organizations to broaden networks and collaborate with diverse professionals.

                            Motivated by her role as president of ARSC, Yuri envisions establishing two-year residency programs for new graduates to bridge the gap between experienced collectors and students to foster knowledge exchange. This aligns with other LIS students' desires for greater emphasis on professional work, such as internships, as highlighted in survey responses by Cherry et al. 2011. According to their survey, &ldquo;The option of greater emphasis on professional work (e.g., internships) received support from over 90% of respondents and was the only option strongly supported by the majority&rdquo; &lpar;129&rpar;.

                            Overall, Yuri advocates for initiatives that enhance practical training, foster collaboration, and contribute to a shared repository of knowledge in the audio archiving field, addressing students' calls for greater emphasis on practical experience to feel more confident in their skills upon completing their degree. In service of this, she recommends students join ARSC while completing the MLIS or as recent graduates because they offer further educational opportunities that are not available in school.

                <p class="text-dark mb-5 text-center">In 2019-2020, the Society of California Archivists (SCA) Labor Issues Task Force conducted a survey reviewing labor issues within the archival field, receiving 197 responses. The survey found that nearly 78&percnt; of respondents !!!!<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BasementTapesDay/">Basement Tapes Day</a> &ldquo;had held project, contract, or temporary positions&hellip; Of 144 responses, the average number of contract positions was 2.7.&rdquo;. Yuri highlights this problematic reliance on term positions in her own work history, having held multiple temporary and grant-funded term jobs throughout her career. When job searching, she was not interested in going through this stressful process again, and part of what attracted her to her current job was its permanent status and potential for growth.

                According to !!!!! <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BasementTapesDay/">Basement Tapes Day</a>a 2019 survey conducted by the Issues and Advocacy section of the Society of American Archivists (SAA), 29&percnt; of 347 respondents stated that their mental health was impacted by working a temporary position, including affecting anxiety, stress, financial insecurity, and self-worth. Multiple respondents stated that their temporary positions were impacting their ability to make big life decisions because of the associated financial instability. !!!!!<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BasementTapesDay/">Basement Tapes Day</a>Most respondents to SCA&apos;s survey felt there was no possibility for growth in their temporary positions. Particularly when anticipating long&ndash;term collection stewardship needs, Yuri advocates for employers to explore alternative funding models beyond grants. 
                </p>
                <p>insert <video src="#"></video></p>
                <p>The Term Labor Best Practices Working Group created a set of !!!!! <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BasementTapesDay/">Basement Tapes Day</a> Best Practices for Archival Term Positions, which addresses the exploitative nature of temporary positions and offers best practices for creating term positions. This includes transparency in duties and salary in job postings, adequate compensation and benefits, and providing opportunities for professional development. These standards can also be useful when job searching, as they can help a job hunter identify if a term position will benefit and support them in the long run.

               !!!!<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BasementTapesDay/">Basement Tapes Day</a>  83% of respondents to SCA&apos;s survey agreed that &ldquo;the prevalence of temporary and term employment,&rdquo; was one of &ldquo;the biggest challenges to fair and ethical archival labor,&rdquo; shortly followed by inadequate pay at 81&percnt;. Yuri looks towards her colleagues at the Academy Archives and Academy Library who are !!!!<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BasementTapesDay/">Basement Tapes Day</a> unionizing and fighting to be adequately compensated for all of their contributions, and she hopes that these efforts will give others in the field something to reference in their own labor advocacy. She encourages educational institutions to consider the outcomes of their graduates and unite behind alumni working in media archives, and advocate for these roles to influence systemic change.

               <p><img src="laborgraph.jpeg" </p>
                <p>Following inadequate pay, 54&percnt; of respondents to the SCA survey identified lack of diversity as one of the biggest labor challenges in the archival field. Within media archives, Yuri points out that there continues to be very few women, particularly women of color, in leadership roles.</p>
                <p>insert <video src="#"></video></p>
                <p>Yuri highlights a BIPOC archivist group created by members of the Association of Moving Image Archivists &lpar;AMIA&rpar; as a place to go for support. The group meets monthly and provides a space for people to check in with and get advice from one another, and despite no longer being a member of AMIA, Yuri feels welcome in this community. 
                </p>
                <p>In general, Yuri has found the most support by making connections with colleagues and fellow members of her cohort. These people have been vital for her when she was facing difficulties at work and needing advice. She also received assurance through talking to predecessors of her position, particularly when she moved into academia and experienced a brand new work environment.</p>

                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">The Association for Recorded Sound Collections &lpar;ARSC&rpar; and The International Association for Sound and Audiovisual Archives &lpar;IASA&rpar; have been pivotal in Yuri&apos;s professional and personal development. These two organizations create standards for archival media materials on the national and global scale and are the two places archivists look to for technical manuals and mechanical information. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Both associations hold annual conferences. ARSC&apos;s semi-annual publication, ARSC Journal, is sent to all members while the IASA&apos;s bi-annual publication, the Journal of the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives, is freely available online. Both include up&ndash;to&ndash;date research about the care of and preservation for media collections. 
                        </p>
                        <p>ARSC hosts freely accessible webinars on their website that have included topics such as job hunting in the media archival field, critical cataloging, managing digital assets, and archiving Hip Hop music. They also publish a newsletter three times a year that includes information about grants, the annual conference, relevant publications, and more. 
                        </p>
                        <p>This year, the organization is planning for a one-day workshop on archival advocacy, including creating a PDF of resources for current professionals who need guidance advocating for the work their organization is doing. Yuri stresses the importance of attending conferences when possible. These conferences allow for face-to-face connections between colleagues working all over the world, and it is these connections that keep people involved in and contributing to these organizations. 
                        </p>
                        <p>insert <video src="#"></video></p>
                        <p>As the incoming President of ARSC, Yuri is hoping to do more to facilitate these connections and serve the membership base. One way she is hoping to do this is through creating the aforementioned two-year residencies connecting people new to the field to those with extensive audio experience. This would help prevent the ongoing knowledge obsolescence happening as people retire and don&apos;t have a way to share their knowledge with emerging professionals. Yuri sees the role of ARSC and related professional organizations as gathering and dispersing knowledge that individuals may not have on their own, particularly related to technical guidelines, digitization practices, and equipment maintenance. ARSC is unique in how it includes both archives professionals and collectors passionate about recorded sound. This means that some ARSC members are interacting with those who will steward their collections some day, and that best practices get developed and shared by a wide range of people.</p>
                        <p>insert <video src="#"></video></p>
                        <p>Yuri encourages people to volunteer with organizations that interest them. Without people willing to do the work, these organizations won&apos;t continue to evolve and serve their members. Yuri served on the executive board of IASA, and though it was extremely difficult it is something she would not trade for anything. It gave her the ability to work with people all around the world, including people whose work she already knew of and respected.
                        The Audio Engineering Society &lpar;AES&rpar; and the Northeast Document Conservation Center &lpar;NEDCC&rpar; are two more organizations for recorded sound archivists to look out for. Yuri notes that membership in AES is expensive &lpar;though they do have a student member discount&rpar;, but she typically joins around the time of conferences focused on archiving and preservation. Attending the conference provides opportunities to ask questions of world-renowned experts in audio engineering. AES also holds yearly conventions in the United States and Europe and publishes the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society ten times a year. NEDCC has many resources related to preservation best-practices. Some are free, like guidelines for cleaning audio machines and shipping audio media, and some are paid, like a six-session virtual class titled Fundamentals of AV Preservation. 
                        The Association of Moving Image Archivists (AMIA) is another organization that those working with media collections may want to check out, though it is focused on moving image media rather than recorded sound. AMIA also has a yearly conference and publishes a journal titled The Moving Image. They have some freely accessible webinars (and more that are on demand or for members), a listserv available to non-members, and a page for related job listings.</p>
